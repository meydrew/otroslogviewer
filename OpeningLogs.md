OtrosLogViewer can read log files from local disks or remote file systems. The supported file sytems are:
  * Local disk
  * FTP
  * SFTP
  * Samba
  * Http/Https (drag and drop link from browser)

You can open the log files in three modes:
  * open - file is read once and closed
  * tailing - file is read to the end and waiting for new content. If file is overwritten, starts reading from beginning. This work similar to `tail -f` on Unix.
  * open a saved log investigation. You can save your log investigation  (marked events, added notes).
